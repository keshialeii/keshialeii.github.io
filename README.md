What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
Creating a website from scratch is not an easy task. It takes a lot of effort and one should be aware of minor details. Styling certain features can be done more efficiently if grouped within the style section. I still have a lot of things to improve on, including identifying which features or items I must group for a more efficient code writing. I also should practice creating more static websites to be more familiar with different tags I can use for a better website.
